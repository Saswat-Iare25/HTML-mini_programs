# Enquiry Form (Mini Web Project)

This project is a **simple enquiry form webpage** built using basic **HTML**, **CSS**, and a bit of **JavaScript** for client-side validation.  
It is designed to demonstrate form handling, styling, and basic validation logic.

## 📁 Project Structure

========
├── Miniprog.html   # Main HTML file containing the enquiry form
└── mini.css        # External stylesheet for page styling

The page displays an **Enquiry Form** where users can enter details like:
- Name

- Password  
- Mobile number

## 🎨 Styling (mini.css)

The `mini.css` file provides:
- A **dark navy blue background** for the page  
- A **centered heading** with shadow effect  
- Stylish **table layout with spacing and rounded borders**  
- Properly formatted **input fields, dropdowns, and buttons**  
- Hover effects for buttons  
- Highlighted error message styling (`#snameErr`)
