# Enquiry Form (Mini Web Project)

This project is a simple enquiry form webpage built using basic **HTML**, **CSS**, and a bit of **JavaScript**.
It is designed to show form handling, styling, and basic validation logic.

## Project Structure


Miniprog.html   # Main HTML file containing the enquiry form
mini.css        # External stylesheet for page styling

## Preview

The page displays an **Enquiry Form** where users can enter details like:
- Name  
- Email  
- Password  
- Mobile number  
- Upload Resume  
- Select Courses  
- Choose Track (Normal/Fast/Workshop)  
- Select Qualifications  
- Choose Occupation  
- Write Address  

Each section is neatly formatted inside a centered table.

## Styling (mini.css)

The `mini.css` file provides:
- A **dark navy blue background** for the page  
- A **centered heading** with shadow effect  
- Stylish **table layout with spacing and rounded borders**  
- Properly formatted **input fields, dropdowns, and buttons**  
- Hover effects for buttons  
- Highlighted error message styling (`#snameErr`)

## Functionality (JavaScript)

The page includes a basic JavaScript validation:
- Checks if the **SName (student name)** field is empty.
- Displays a red error message and alert if left blank.
